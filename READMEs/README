There are two version the solution.
1. using values in an array.
2. using doubly linked list.

Objectives.
With version I, values are searched.
With version II, Pointers are constructed and compared with reference values.

Terminating conditions:
In version I: There is link between the last node and the first node after the head, "loop detection" serves as a terminating
              guarantee.
In version II: NULL pointer at the end of the list will result in NULL next value.


Verification:
In version I, values are searched
In version II, newly constructed next pointers are compared with pre-build (existing) next pointers.

common to both:
Each node in the linked list is visited by calculating its pointer value from the previous node and itself.
